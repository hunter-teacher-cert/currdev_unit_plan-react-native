Directions: Your unit plan draft proposal should have the following parts:
* High level description of unit content.
* Rationale for creating the unit.
* Placement of unit in existing class/sequence.

#Unit plan
##High Level description
###Have students create an emulation of an app they use using react native
###react native can be used to create interactive webpages, android apps, and ios apps. I believe this will be a valuable skill for students to have in the workforce and if students ever want to bring an app to life.
###I want to cover this either right before the AP CSP portfolio as a way for students to make interactive, beautiful apps for their portfolio. Depending on time, I may want to cover this after the portfolio as an extension of javascript since vanilla javascript is just a scratch on the surface.
