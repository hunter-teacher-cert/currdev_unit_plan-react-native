Directions: Your unit plan draft proposal should have the following parts:
* High level description of unit content.
* Rationale for creating the unit.
* Placement of unit in existing class/sequence.

#Unit plan
##High Level description
Teach students objects using Javascript and introduce Bootstrap
##Goal
Many students in my class take AP CSA afterward and I think this introduction would be helpful for them to encounter. We are already using dot notation to use objects and their functions. I feel this would clarify some of the reasons why we do what we do. I also want to start incorporating some of the bootstrap elements to help students create beautiful websites.
