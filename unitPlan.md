# Object Oriented Programming for AP CSP
by Jiyoon Kim

-----

## General Overview
This unit is designed to be inserted into the end of an AP CSP curriculum. It will provide an overview and an introduction to object oriented programming. Students will learn how to make objects, give them attributes, and create functions for those objects. The summative assessment for the unit will be a project where students display trading cards.

## Motivation for Unit
There were 2 motives for creating this unit. First, I found my students were struggling using functions that involved dot notation. Second, many of my students take AP CSA after my course. I think this unit will be a good connection to that unit to provide that background.
